## A) Tables

Table S1. Site characteristics. Infrastructure ID is the unique ID
assigned to each individual site, where CON indicates a grey alley, RV indicates a green alley, and SS indicates a street segment. Parallel street names one of the parallel streets to each alley, and for street segments it indicates the street segment that was sampled for each alley. City is where the sampling occurred, VSMPE = Villeray-Saint Michel-Parc Extension and TR = Trois-Rivières. Infrastructure type indicates the site type, with three potential options, green alley, grey alley, and street segment. Percent canopy indicates the percent canopy of the site in decimal form. Firefly presence is a binomial variable, where 1 indicates that fireflies were found, 0 indicates no fireflies
were found, and a blank indicates that the site was not sampled for fireflies. Number of points is the number of points where vegetative complexity was sampled (i.e., number of 10 m intervals).

# B) Methodological Details

### Canopy Cover

We calculated percent canopy cover of all green alleys, grey alleys, and
street segments using publicly available LiDAR data collected in 2020 at
a spatial resolution of 1 m (Institut National de Santé Publique du
Québec and Gouvernement du Québec, 2022). For street segments, we
calculated the canopy cover of sidewalks using the same dataset.
Sidewalk boundaries were extracted from an open dataset for VSMPE (Ville
de Montréal, 2024) and hand-drawn for TR using QGIS 3.16.8 (QGIS
Development Team, 2020).

### Tree Diversity

Tree diversity was assessed in two ways. First, we calculated the
species richness of each alley and street segment by counting the number
of unique tree species. We identified the species of each individual in
the field (Farrar, 1995; Little, 1980). If a tree species could not be
identified in the field, it was marked as unknown (n = 1/1,469). If a
tree was dead, it was still recorded but was removed from the diversity
calculations (n = 7/1,469). We recorded a total of 75 species (Table
S2).

The second diversity metric was functional diversity. Using the original
dataset and methodology from Paquette et al. (2021), we assigned a
functional group to each of the tree species present in our dataset
(Belluau et al., 2021, Table S2). The database published online did not
have a functional group assignment for 15 of our species (20%,
predominantly cultivars), thus those species were removed from the
functional diversity calculations. If a cultivar or hybrid was not
present in the database, but both parent species were and they shared
the same functional group, we assigned the functional group of the
parent species to the cultivar. We then summed how many functional
groups each alley or street segment contained.

### Proportion of Invasives/Natives

To assess the proportion of invasive and native species at each study
site, we assigned a status of native or invasive to each of our study
species (Padvaiskas et al., subm, Philp, 2024, Table S2). A species’
native range was evaluated using the St. Lawrence Lowlands ecoregion.
The St. Lawrence Lowlands ecoregion surrounds the St. Lawrence River
ranging from Quebec City south through Montreal and just beyond Ottawa
(Minister of Industry, 2010). If the native range of a species fell
within a region we deemed it native to that region (Canadian Wildlife
Federation, 2024; Dirr and Warren, 2019; Fryer, 2018; Government of
Canada, 2013; The Morton Arboretum, 2022; Tree Canada, 2024; United
States Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources Conservation
Service, 2024; Woody Invasives of the Great Lakes Collaborative, 2019).

We categorized invasive species based on sources within the Eastern
Temperate Forest ecoregion (The Morton Arboretum, 2022; Woody Invasives
of the Great Lakes Collaborative, 2019). This is a larger ecoregion
which runs west to east from Ontario to Nova Scotia and north to south
from Southern Canada to Florida, USA (bplant.org, 2024). Any cultivar of
a parent species that was considered invasive was also recorded as
invasive. Hybrids with an invasive parent were noted as invasive only if
the invasive traits persisted in the hybrid (Dirr and Warren, 2019).
Once each species was assigned a status, we calculated the proportion of
stems at each site that were native and invasive.

### Vegetative Complexity

We measured vegetative complexity by walking through each study site and
stopping every 10 m. At each stop, we assessed which of the 5 following
vegetative layers were present: ground cover, herbaceous vegetation,
wall vegetation, shrubs, or canopy. If the presence of one of the layers
was less than 1% of the area, it was ignored (e.g., one dandelion does
not indicate the presence of an herbaceous vegetation layer). We define
wall vegetation as vines and crawling vegetation that live on fences or
walls. Average vegetative complexity of alleys and street segments was
calculated by summing the total number of layers counted and then
dividing by the number of points measured.

### Firefly Presence

To assess the habitat quality of our study alleys, we selected a subset
of alleys in VSMPE and performed a presence/absence survey of fireflies
(Family: Lampyridae). Fireflies are known bioindicators in cities, as
they require leaf litter, access to water, and low levels of light
pollution (Firefly Atlas et al., 2023; Picchi et al., 2013). We selected
the 28 green alleys with the highest canopy cover and most vegetative
complexity for our subset, the five grey alleys with the least canopy
cover and vegetative complexity as our controls, and the associated
street segment for all 34 alleys surveyed. We sampled in groups of three
between dusk and early nightfall, between 9:00 and 11:30 pm. Each person
surveyed a section of the alley for five minutes and watched for the
presence of fireflies. When a firefly was seen, the sampler recorded its
presence. After 5 minutes, each person rotated spots and repeated the
survey in the next segment. We did this three times for each alley. We
did not sample in the rain, when firefly flight does not occur (Firefly
Atlas et al., 2023; Picchi et al., 2013). If the presence of a firefly
was noted in any of the surveys, the alley was assigned as having
fireflies present.

### DBH

We assessed the presence of large trees in two ways, we calculated the
mean observed tree DBH and the mean potential height for each study
site. To calculate mean observed DBH, we evaluated tree size by
identifying and measuring the diameter at breast height (DBH) of every
tree (defined as a woody plant \> 2 m tall) found in the alley. If a
tree had a split stem with the split above or near DBH, we measured the
DBH at the narrowest part of the stem below the fork. If the split
occurred below DBH but above 6” from the ground, we measured each stem
individually and calculated DBH by taking the square root of the sum of
all squared stem DBHs. If the split occurred below 6” from the ground,
we counted the stems as separate individuals (Magarik et al., 2020). We
then took the average DBH of all the trees in an alley or street
segment.

# E) Prior Predictive Checks

Prior predictive checks are used to ensure that the values selected for
priors for our models allow a biologically reasonable range of values.
For numeric predictor variables, we simulate predictive draws for prior
only models and visualize the slope/intercept of the values. We then do
a "posterior predictive check" but with the prior only model, to see if
the data is captured in the priors. Note that all data is scaled and
centered in these data.

For Trois-Rivieres, there is only a categorical predictor variable.
Therefore, only the posterior predictive check is presented.

# F) Model Diagnostics

These model diagnostic plots assess whether the chains of our models are
converged and well mixed, and if the model is well specified and has an
adequate fit.

The first plot of the series shows trace plots for each of our
parameters, where we want to see stationary and well-mixed chains. The
second plot shows an autocorrelation plot by chain and parameter. We
want our autocorrelation to quickly drop to zero with increasing lag.
Thirdly, the Rhat plot monitors whether a chain has converged to the
equilibrium distribution, if all chains are at equilibrium Rhat will be
one. If chains have not converged, Rhat will be greater than 1. The
fourth plot is the ratio between effective sample size (Neff) and total
sample size (N).Because the draws within a Markov chain are not
independent if there is autocorrelation, the effective sample size,
neff, is usually smaller than the total sample size, N. The larger the
ratio, the better. Finally, we have the posterior predictive check where
we want the black line to be within/close to the blue lines, to indicate
that our model is adequately generative.
